# Tasks

## Task 1: Hello, World!
- Write a simple JavaScript program that displays "Hello, World!" in the console.
- Execute the program to see the output in your browser's developer console.


## Task 2: Variables and Data Types
- Read more about JavaScript's basic data types: strings, numbers, booleans, and null/undefined.
- Declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const` and understand their differences.


## Task 3: Operators and Expressions - Calculate Pizza Cost
**Objective:** Practice using arithmetic operators in JavaScript to calculate the total cost of ordering pizza.

### Description:

1. Create a JavaScript program that calculates the cost of ordering pizza.

2. Define the following variables at the beginning of your program:
    - `pizzaPrice` - The base price of a pizza (e.g., $10).
    - `toppingPrice` - The additional cost for each topping (e.g., $2 per topping).
    - `numberOfToppings` - The number of toppings the customer wants on their pizza (e.g., 3 toppings).

3.  Calculate the total cost of the pizza including the toppings using JavaScript arithmetic operators.

4. Display a message to the user that includes the base price, the number of toppings, the cost per topping, and the total cost. For example:
`"You ordered a pizza with 3 toppings at $2 each. The total cost is $16."`

*Hints:*
- Utilize addition (`+`) and multiplication (`*`) operators in your calculations.
- Make use of variables to store the base price, topping price, and number of toppings for improved flexibility and code readability.
- Feel free to experiment by changing the values of these variables to observe different outcomes.
